# Compiling on Bristol Bluecrystal4 server with intel compiler (with netcdf)   The latest cuda is libs/cuda/11.4.2-gcc-5.4.0-2.26 at 23 Dec 2021.
#however, with the latest version of cuda,we got the following error: #error The version of CUB in your include path is not compatible with this release of Thrust. 
#CUB is now included in th so you no Longer need to use your own checkout of CUB. Define THRUST IGNORE_CUB VERSION_CHECK to ignore this.
#compared with bp3, we modified the NetCDF dir with the last 2 sentence in this file.
